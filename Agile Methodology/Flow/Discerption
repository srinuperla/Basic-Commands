Agile Model came into picture:
In Agile everything is sprints
Sprints is nothing but the iterations
Each sprint can span upto 2 weeks.

Requirements decomposed into some thing called user stories.
Everyday there will be scrum meeting
Stakeholder
Scrum master – key player for the release of the sprints/project
Sprint planning
Sprint – identified – feasible to be worked upon user stories
